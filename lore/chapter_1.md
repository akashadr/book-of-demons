The 12 hours of travel have tired you, you can't feel your legs after sitting in the deck filled with refugees in the skyship.
World is pretty weird place for you, last summer you are just a hunter/gatherer living your life in the forest of gods (that what you used to call that place) but people from sky just came and captured your whole tribe for their different experiments to study the body of people from forests of devil (this is what they call your forest). Life has been pretty harsh after that, you all are captured and locked in the facility built on the edge of forest after seeing many things in facility you are confused and frightend. From a old man, you met on the facility you got to learned about your captors, they are the people from sky and before he can say anyhting a long howl was heard and before you can know anything you are here in this sky ship.

You cant speak the language of the people on ship with you and fron the way their eyes look they seem just like you to totally clueless. You are not really know what to do so you just sit there and wait for someone to tell what will happen with you. Now that you can see some shilloute in the long distance. 

After some time you know what to do.
